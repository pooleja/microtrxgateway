    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
    The microTrx project is an open source collection of software geared towards implementing Bitcoin Payment Channels.  Payment Channels hold the promise of allowing senders and recievers to almost entirely get rid of the transaction fees associated with bitcoin payments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though many people are assuming Bitcoin will be a joke to look back at in 10 years, we think different.  We believe Bitcoin has the potential to bring billions of people into the world banking system, to allow money to transfer instantly and freely between people, and to spawn new and unimaginable industries through its programmable systems.
